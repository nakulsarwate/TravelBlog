It is fascinating to see the tiger or the Leopard  in the wild, but it is just as fascinating to see the other animals too. 
We saw a Gaur break down a termite hill, and another one out - stared us as we tried to pass him on the road. Monkeys played around spotted deer, and a herd of Barasingha stuck together and forced a tiger to think again and give up attacking them. 
It is moments like these which make a jaunt into the wild memorable, whether we spot the big cats or not. 
Since the last few days I have been offline, thanks to the intermittent network here, but you can expect a slew of photographs soon.

Hello from Kanha,  where we are spending the next few days of our #summertrip2017 
Our first jaunt into the jungle wasn't very satisfying.  Clubbed with a group of chattering kids and irritating adults, we also just missed seeing about 5 tigers, which added to the frustration. Spotting these jackals was the only consolation, and we did spot a few birds as well. More pics later.... stay tuned for more updates.

Travelling in May, I had been mentally prepared for little or no water in the falls. I was debating whether to even go to see them, when my driver assured me that there was indeed water. We were sceptical, but agreed, and there it was,  the Dhuandhar falls in (almost) all its glory.

The marble rocks were just as impressive, if not more. And the running commentary of our boatman amused me, and irritated Samhith, because he had seen none of the films the boatman kept talking about which had been filmed here! 
We spent almost half the day at Bhedaghat, and with the Chausath Yogini temple, it was one memorable visit. 
We are now at Kanha, and wondering if our experience here will top the ones so far.... Or not.... Fingers crossed.

This is one temple I have yearned to visit, and finally did, this afternoon, during a short jaunt from Jabalpur, en route our final destination for #summertrip2017 
The temple, though named for the 64 yoginis,  actually has around 94 of them! Swipe to see some of them. 
The yoginis are so intricately carved, with detailed iconography, which helps identify them. Most of their names are inscribed below them, helping us out. 
The first two images show the Yoginis in their niches, around the circumference of the temple. The third image shows Varahi, the fourth Sarvatomukhi,  the fifth is Erudi,  the sixth is Rushini,  the seventh is Virendri, holding a sword, and the eighth is Phanendri,  with a snake hood. 
These are just a few of the images in the temple.  It was worth braving the scorching sun and the blistering heat of the stones, to see them! 
@sudhageee and @shubhrachatterji
 These are especially for you. 😀

The temple, though named for the 64 yoginis,  actually has around 94 of them! Swipe to see some of them. 
The yoginis are so intricately carved, with detailed iconography, which helps identify them. Most of their names are inscribed below them, helping us out. 
The first two images show the Yoginis in their niches, around the circumference of the temple. The third image shows Varahi, the fourth Sarvatomukhi,  the fifth is Erudi,  the sixth is Rushini,  the seventh is Virendri, holding a sword, and the eighth is Phanendri,  with a snake hood. 
These are just a few of the images in the temple.  It was worth braving the scorching sun and the blistering heat of the stones, to see them! 
@sudhageee and @shubhrachatterji
 These are especially for you. 😀

Chausath Yogini temple, Bhedaghat,  near Jabalpur. 
This is one temple I have yearned to visit, and finally did, this 
afternoon, during a short jaunt from Jabalpur, en route our final 
destination for #summertrip2017

We started the day at Ramtek,  visiting the temple to Lord Ram, as well as the Jain temple. The surprise was the beautiful varaha of whom I posted a pic earlier as well. 
We then stopped to see the site of the massive temple at Mansar,  and then headed to Adasa,  where the Ganesha was so cute. However, it was sad to see massive sculptures either covered with sindoor, or lying around, broken and ignored. 
There is so much to see here,  and we barely managed to skim the surface, braving the scorching summer sun to see what we could. 
Meanwhile, it has also been a good experience to stay in one of the retiring rooms at the station,  as we await our train to our next destination. The last pic shows the corridor just outside our room. Pretty good isn't it?
